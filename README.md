## Problem Statement

We are sharing data for our live demo classes right from parents showing interest in their conversion (Parent bought the live classes pack).

## Following are the details of the data:
1. Interested Users – Users (child) who have shown interest in joining the demo classes.
2. Booked Users – Users who booked a trail class on our portal. There are cases where duplicate trails are possible, count both.
3. Trainers – Trainers assigned to Trail Batch.
4. Subscription Bought – Details of Sales that are made. Use only those cases where sale value is greater than equal to 499/-.

## Using these data, create following metrics:
1. Sales conversion with respect to Trainers
2. Sales conversion with respect to Time slot
3. Sales conversion with respect to Topic
4. Sales conversion with respect to Source (Field available in Interested Users)
5. Sales conversion wrt grade
6. Time taken for Sales conversion
7. Time slot – attendance %

Sales conversion refers to the number of users who have bought the session after showing interest and attending the trial session.
